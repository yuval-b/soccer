### Temporal Match Analysis and Recommending Substitutions in Live Soccer Games

This repository contains all the source code and references for the 2021/22 Pawsey Summer Internship.

Uncertainty is an intrinsic feature in a live soccer game. Teams continuously adapt to the situation in the game, applying new tactical formations, substituting players, and so on. Due to this fluid nature, dynamic decision making is normally driven by human experts; the coaches.
As the live game generates a lot of data in a very short period, effective analysis of dynamics in the game would provide valuable new insight and enable coaches to deploy data-backed, real time decisions to impact the game's outcome. 
We investigate using network metrics and event logs data to correlate temporal network metrics to match prediction and use those results in order to recommend substitutions based on performance of players and wider team tactics.
